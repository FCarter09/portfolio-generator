                <p>We created an app for pet lovers far & wide! Our app, Pet Store, allows the user to pick their favorite products & services for their dog or cat.
                   The user can add things like a grooming session for their pup or a boarding session for their cat. 
                   They can also save their pet in our database so that way the next time they log in, their pet is in there & all they have to do is add their services to the cart & check out!
                    Also a feature in development is access to our calendar for those services & a button/box to request a certain day/time.
                     We created this app using many technologies, the main ones being MERN, MongoDB & GraphSQL.  </p>
